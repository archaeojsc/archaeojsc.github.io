## [Use, Purpose, and Function -- Letting the Artifacts Speak](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/3/3/34) &larrhk;

An article (co-written with my wife) on archaeology, materiality, and theory of
artifact interpretation. This was our first joint publication (hopefully of
many). The theme is how we view, use, and interact with the material objects
around us and how we, as archaeologists, can interpret the artifacts of the
past through that lens.

## [Sets, Graphs, and Things We Can See: A Formal Combinatorial Ontology for Empirical Intra-Site Analysis](https://journal.caa-international.org/articles/10.5334/jcaa.16/) &larrhk;

My first journal article. It's a deep-dive into the theory and methodology of
the data content of archaeological sites, along with a "primer" for
archaeologists on set and graph theory. The major finding was that
archaeological sites, assemblages, and contexts can be formalized as a system
of multisets.
