# Portfolio

Experienced project manager, research analyst, and social scientist with a 20+
years' record of technical innovation and team leadership. Specialized in
exploratory and experimental analytics for complex and unstructured data.
Expertise in geo-spatial pattern detection and latent feature analysis.

I've spent my career using data to tell detailed stories about what people were
doing hundreds or thousands of years in the past from the patterns in tiny
pieces of pottery, bits of stone or bone, or subtle differences in soils.

The odds are good that I can find patterns in your data as well.
