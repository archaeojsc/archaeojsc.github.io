  Recording of a paper I presented a couple years ago for the 2019 
  Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) 
  international conference at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. 
  The topic was discussing the various abstractions and formalization 
  involved in parsing compelx systems of sets in an archaeological context, 
  but I drift into a bit of information theory, distance norms, 
  and high dimensionality.
