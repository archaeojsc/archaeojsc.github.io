[Point and Line to Hyperplane](https://youtu.be/sMj125KFeiM)
Recording of a paper I presented a couple years ago for the 2019 
Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) 
international conference at Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, Poland. 
The topic was discussing the various abstractions and formalization 
involved in parsing compelx systems of sets in an archaeological context, 
but I drift into a bit of information theory, distance norms, 
and high dimensionality.
