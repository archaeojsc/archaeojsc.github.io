### Projects

   href="">
  Mapping linguistic psychometrics using NLP/NLU 
  and graph community detection
</a>

<p>
   Practicum project at GA Tech. My teammate and I applied natural language 
   processing, functional linguistics, and belief network analysis to detect 
   styles of political speech in a sample of social media posts. Using specific 
   parts of speech (i.e., pronouns) as psychometric indicators of discourse 
   style, we extracted linguistic markers for clusivity and affinity to 
   identify agonistic speech acts, conviction of belief, affiliation, 
   and sentiment.

   href="">
  Semantic modeling of paper topics using 
  topological overlap matrix (TOM) adjacency
</a>

<p>
   Data and Visual Analytics (DVA) class project at GA Tech. 
   My teammates and I performed topic extraction and modeling 
   of the semantic associations between COVID-19 research 
   abstracts as a searchable knowledge graph. Used a 
   transformer-based NLP topic extraction to form a network 
   of topically related research papers. Communities detected 
   within that graph corresponded to a biclustering of associations 
   that simultaneously describe the similarity between articles 
   and topics, providing conceptually driven semantic search.

   href="">  
  Spatio-temporal assemblage analysis of Fort Edward, New York  
</a>

<p>
   Performed spatio-temporal analysis of artifact assemblages by 
   adapting weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) to the 
   3D locations of particular diagnostic artifacts in order to 
   reconstruct sequences of deposition across the archaeological 
   excavations.

### Publications

<a target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer" 
   href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/3/3/34">  
  Use, Purpose, and Function—Letting the Artifacts Speak  
</a>

<p>
  An article (co-written with my wife) on archaeology, materiality, 
  and theory of artifact interpretation. This was our first joint 
  publication (hopefully of many). The theme is how we view, use, 
  and interact with the material objects around us and how we, 
  as archaeologists, can interpret the artifacts of the past 
  through that lens.

  Sets, Graphs, and Things We Can See: A Formal 
  Combinatorial Ontology for Empirical Intra-Site Analysis
</a>

<p>
  My first journal article. It's a deep-dive into the theory 
  and methodology of the data content of archaeological sites, 
  along with a "primer" for archaeologists on set and graph theory.
  The major finding was that archaeological sites, assemblages, and 
  contexts can be formalized as a system of multisets.

### Presentations and Posters 

[Why is a Raven like a Writing Desk?](pdf/CRIDC2020.pdf)

<p>
   Poster presented at the 2020 virtual Career, Research, Innovation and 
   Development Conference (CRIDC) at GA Tech. There is much discussion 
   about the ethics and perceived bias in machine learning and artificial 
   intelligence. We took what we believe to be a somewhat different 
   approach to the question -- do we really know what we are training 
   such models on? More specifically, are we training on characteristics 
   that are truly innate or merely on our own implicit perceptions of 
   associations?

  Point and Line to Hyperplane
</a>

<p>
  Recording of a paper I presented at the 2019 Computer Applications 
  and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) international 
  conference at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. 
  The topic was discussing the various abstractions and formalization 
  involved in parsing compelx systems of sets in an archaeological context, 
  but I drift into a bit of information theory, distance norms, 
  and high dimensionality.

  Matrix in the Network
</a>
<p>
  Recording of a paper I presented at the 2018 
  Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) 
  international conference at the University of Tübingen, Germany. 
  The topic was possible applications of set and graph theory to the 
  analysis of archaeological assemblages.
