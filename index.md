  Use, Purpose, and Function—Letting the Artifacts Speak
</a>

<p>
  An article (co-written with my wife) on archaeology, materiality, 
  and theory of artifact interpretation. This was our first joint 
  publication (hopefully of many). The theme is how we view, use, 
  and interact with the material objects around us and how we, 
  as archaeologists, can interpret the artifacts of the past 
  through that lens.

  Sets, Graphs, and Things We Can See: A Formal Combinatorial Ontology for Empirical Intra-Site Analysis
</a>

<p>
  My first journal article. It's a deep-dive into the theory 
  and methodology of the data content of archaeological sites, 
  along with a "primer" for archaeologists on set and graph theory.
  The major finding was that archaeological sites, assemblages, and 
  contexts can be formalized as a system of multisets.

### Presentations and Posters 

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/sMj125KFeiM">
  Point and Line to Hyperplane
</a>

<p>
  Recording of a paper I presented at the 2019 Computer Applications 
  and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) international 
  conference at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. 
  The topic was discussing the various abstractions and formalization 
  involved in parsing compelx systems of sets in an archaeological context, 
  but I drift into a bit of information theory, distance norms, 
  and high dimensionality.

  Matrix in the Network
</a>
<p>
  Recording of a paper I presented at the 2018 
  Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) 
  international conference at the University of Tübingen, Germany. 
  The topic was possible applications of set and graph theory to the 
  analysis of archaeological assemblages.
