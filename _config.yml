  I've been a professional Archaeologist specializing in spatial and quantitative 
  inference for most of my career, with particular focus on computational analyses 
  for partitioning complex sets. I have just completed a second graduate degree
  in Data Science, and looking to shift more towards full time analytics and 
  machine learning research.
