  For most of my career, I've been a professional archaeologist specializing 
  in spatial and quantitative inference. My focus has been on computational analyses 
  for partitioning complex sets, GIS and geo-statistics, and a bit of 3D photogrammetry
  for recording site features in situ.

  After completing a second graduate degree in data science, I'm now 
  shifting more towards full time analytics and  machine learning research.  
  As a data scientist, my interests are still primarily in unsupervised and 
  semi-supervised learning. I've mainly been concentrating on Bayesian analysis, 
  graph-based algorithms, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Understanding (NLU).
